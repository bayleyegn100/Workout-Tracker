## Description 

I developed a back end code for the workout tracker app. By using this app it is possible to track the name, type, weight, sets, repetetions,
 and duration of the exercise. In addition to that the user can add exercise to the most recent or to a new plan. Moreover,
 it is possible to view the combined weight of multiple exercises and total durations fo each workout. 
 The application designed for any one who want to use it. To develop this application, 
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called 
Node Package Manager (npm), express, Mongo data base, Mogoose  schema, node.js and other relevant node.js framworks.
