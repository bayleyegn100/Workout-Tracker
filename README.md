## Description 

I developed a backend code for the workout tracker app. By using this app it is possible to track the name, type, weight, sets, repetetions, and duration of the exercise. In addition to that the user can add exercise to the most recent or to a new plan. Moreover, it is possible to view the combined weight of multiple exercises and total durations fo each workout. 
The application designed for any one who want to use it. To develop this application, 
I used Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm), express, Mongo data base, Mongoose schema, node.js and other relevant node.js frameworks.

## Instructions

If you interested you can use and start tracking your workouts. If you want to test the app first right click on the server.js file and click on ‘open on integrated terminal’ or you can use a terminal and drag or write the file inside opened terminal. If it is going well type node server.js and hit the enter button. Following that the server start to listen on port. Now you can open a google chrome and run a http://localhost:3003. Here you will get a fitness tracker appliction and you can manupulate as you need it. If you face any problem or would like to reach me, you can find my contact in the question section.
